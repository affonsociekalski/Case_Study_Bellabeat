Conclusion\n\nHere I present the main insights of this analysis with recommendations to address each of them. \n\n* In the analysis of the daily data, the [charts](#question-activity-level) reveal that increasing the time spent in more intense activities (for example, more steps taken in less time) leads to more calories burned without the need to spend a long time in light activities. In other words, **users can burn more calories in less time if they do more intense exercises.** \n  * <span style='color:gray'>**Recommendation 1:** using app notifications, we can engage them in saving up a short time of their journeys to do 10 to 30 very active minutes. There is no need for endless workout routines.</span>\n\n\n* **Users usually [get more active](#active-time-peak) at around 18 (6 p.m.).** A possible reason might be people ending their work shifts and going to the gym or for a run. \n  * <span style='color:gray'>**Recommendation 2:** with that in mind, we could send notifications around 17 (5 p.m.) to remind and motivate them of the few minutes needed to burn an approximate number of calories, their daily goal.</span>\n  * <span style='color:gray'>**Recommendation 3:** Another strategy to engage users is sending notifications or giving them more points for becoming more active at alternative times during the day, e.g., running in the morning.</span>\n  \n\n* **When it comes to [sleeping routine](#sedentary-sleep), our data suggest that the more time you spend in sedentary activity, the less sleep you get.** At this point, it’s important to state that not all users have sleeping data. In fact, minutes spent asleep are often within sedentary minutes. Having access to more data about sleeping habits could offer more insights into what we found here.\n  * <span style='color:gray'>**Recommendation 4:** besides additional data on Sleeping habits, we could provide users with a way of registering how they spend the sedentary minutes. These details would support tools we would employ to motivate users to get more active.</span>\n\n\n* Finally, we need to **keep track of users’ engagement with a healthy lifestyle. We want to know what drives them to pursue their goals and how the initial motivation evolves over the weeks.** That way, we can trigger mechanisms to keep them motivated whenever there is a decrease on a daily basis in the number of steps taken or in the level of activity.\n  * <span style='color:gray'>**Recommendation 5:** to deliver this, we can offer to users a journal where they would register their daily or weekly activities altogether with a point system.</span>\n","metadata":{}}]}
